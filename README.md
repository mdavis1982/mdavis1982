# Hi there 👋🏻
I'm Matthew Davis, a developer and musician from [Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone,_Staffordshire) in Staffordshire.

I specialise in building well tested, maintainable [Laravel](https://laravel.com) applications to solve both simple and complex business needs.

When I'm not sat behind a computer, I can be found musically directing theatre productions across the UK as well as recording and producing click tracks for touring theatre, bands and artists.

I've played drums, percussion and keyboards in over 300 musical theatre productions around the world and have also designed and built click track playback systems for theatre and band use.

I share everything I know about these things through my [blog](https://mattdavis.co.uk).
